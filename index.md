# Nathan Walker's Digital Portfolio

## About
<p>Hello, thank you for taking the time to investigate my portfolio! My name is Nathan Walker, and I am currently pursuing a Master's of Science in Geography at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. I received my undergraduate degree from University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire in Geography and Economics. </p>

<p> With my undergraduate experiences, I discovered a passion for working with data to create inferences and build recommendations for courses of actions. Geography and economics prepped me well to handle datasets, with a diverse toolbox of geospatial and econometric techniques. I pride myself on expanding my knowledge beyond the conventional tools such as ESRI options, and am always looking for new experiences to build my options for analysis and grow as a person. Below are several examples of previous projects I have worked on. If you would like more information, feel free to contact me!
